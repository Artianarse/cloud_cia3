        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Cloud Analytics platform. We provide powerful tools and insights to help you make data-driven
            decisions in the Cloud analytics describes the application of analytic algorithms in the cloud against data
            in a private or public cloud to then deliver a result of interest. Cloud analytics involves deployment of
            scalable cloud computing with powerful analytic software to identify patterns in data and to extract new
            insights. More and more businesses rely on data analysis to gain a competitive advantage, to advance
            scientific discovery, or to improve life in all sorts of ways. Data analytics has therefore become an
            increasingly valuable tool as the quantity and the value of data continue to climb.

            Cloud analytics is often associated with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep
            learning (DL). And it is commonly used in industry applications such as scientific research in genomics or
            in oil and gas fields, business intelligence, security, Internet of Things (IoT), and many others. In fact,
            any industry can benefit from data analytics to improve organizational performance and to drive new value.
